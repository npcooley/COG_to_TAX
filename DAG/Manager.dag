# Overall manager!

# we need to collect:
# the COG list
# the tax dump
# and something else

# A's pre and post script can live here because it's a one shot job that if it fails
# we have bigger problems...
JOB A Plan/Plan.sub

# Within the B subdag pre and post scripts manage success and planning of a 
# 'Run.dag' dag that triggers the actual jobs
SUBDAG EXTERNAL B Collection/Collection.dag

# this node is currently left blank because how we merge COGs and taxonomies to
# form training sets is going to depend a lot on the shape of the data that we collect
# SUBDAG EXTERNAL C Training/Training.dag

# nothing fancy
PARENT A CHILD B
# PARENT B CHILD C

# we don't expect the actual flights released by the subdags to need these retry
# statements to perform their collections correctly, however they're good practice
# just in case any individual job fails for whatever reason ... having the DAG
# manage the retry statements is a little cleaner than having it happen within
# the submit files
# RETRY B 3
# RETRY C 3
